<h2>About Abbeydale Observatory</h2>

<td>Abbeydale Observatory was first set up in July, 1999, though
at the time you could hardly call it an observatory!
I had a 35mm camera lens attached to a MX5 mono CCD
camera. The whole lot was then attached to a battery powered
camera mount.<br>
I had this dream of imaging an asteroid, but with the equipment 
available I was doubtful. It wasn't until 20th August, 1999 that
I imaged my first asteroid!  <a href="Images/Ampella.htm">198
Ampella</a href>
It was one of the most exciting days of my life. And certainly
what really got me hooked on Asteroids.<br>
At the time, it took around 30 to 45 minutes just to manually 
align the camera with the asteroid! Also I had to take all of the
cables and equipment outside and set it up. The whole process
just to take one image was around 2 hours.<br>
A big improvement happened in 2001 when I purchased a
Celestron NexStar 5 telescope that had the GOTO
facility. Finding asteroids from then was a lot quicker. The
drawback with this was that the tracking wasn't that good,
and so only short images could be taken. Even so I still
had the problem of setting up (mentioned before), plus a
heavy telescope.<br>
Next came the Meade LX90.<br>
This is a superb instrument, and from then onwards I was
able to start doing some serious asteroid work. But the scope
was even heavier!<br>
About a year later I was given my Observatory Code J94
from the Minor Planet Centre.<br>
My disability was getting much worse, to the extent that I could
only observe with the help of my wife Lin. The lifting and
carrying was now beyond me on my own.<br>
Then in July 2003, with the help of some very good friends
(the Willoughby family), my <a href="Observatory.htm">observatory </a
href> was built.<br>
Now the whole operation is conducted from my house, and
the scope is run remotely, using some excellent software
written for me by John Rock (MPC 951). My thanks go to him
for the time and effort put in to make this work for me.<br>
Now I am using a Meade LX200 'Classic' 0.3 metre. <br>
The latest milestone is the imaging of my <a href="Images/Sternberga.htm">
500th asteroid!
</a href>
I can't tell you how much this meant to me after all these
years.<br>
<br>
